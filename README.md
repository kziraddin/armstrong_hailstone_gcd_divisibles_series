Armstrong Number Finder:
This script finds Armstrong numbers in a given range (1 to 1000) using a function called is_armstrong_number. Armstrong numbers are numbers where the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the original number.
The code takes a range as input, checks for valid input, and then iterates through the range to find and print Armstrong numbers.

Hailstone Sequence Generator:
This script generates the Hailstone sequence for a randomly chosen number within a given range.
The Hailstone sequence is generated iteratively, and the length of the sequence is printed.

Divisibility Checker:
This script checks if numbers in a given range are divisible by both 3 and 5 and prints a message for each such number.

GCD Calculator:
This script calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
It takes user input for two numbers, calculates their GCD, and prints the result.

Series Sum Calculator:
That script calculates the sum of a series based on a positive integer n provided by the user.
The series is defined as the sum of terms i / (i + 1) for i ranging from 1 to n. The result is printed.
